The comparison entities are:
	- DADDA Multiplier & Array Multiplier (mult)
	- Carry Select Adder & Ripple Carry Adder (suma)

The separately entites are:
	- Sigmoid function (SigmoidLUT)
	- MAC unit (MAC_8b)

In Artificial_Neuron are implemented both an AN (Artificial_Neuron) and a ANN (Neural_Network). Some ANNs that represent binary functions (AND, NOR, OR) are implemented too.
